# Breast_Cancer_Prediction

The Breast Cancer (Wisconsin) Diagnosis dataset contains the diagnosis and a set of 30 features describing the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
There are ten real-valued features which are computed for each cell nucleus:

radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter);
texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values);
perimeter;
area;
smoothness (local variation in radius lengths);
compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0);
concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour);
concave points (number of concave portions of the contour);
symmetry;
fractal dimension (“coastline approximation” - 1).

## What is Fine needle aspiration:
Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a diagnostic procedure used to investigate lumps or masses. In this technique, a thin (23–25 gauge), hollow needle is inserted into the mass for sampling of cells that, after being stained, will be examined under a microscope (biopsy). Fine-needle aspiration biopsies are very safe minor surgical procedures
